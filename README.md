# Fagpraksisdemo-TestDataFactory-Javafaker
A very simple demo to show how to make better test data using test data factory and javafaker. 

Javafaker produces realistic randomized test data and realistic test data produces realistic test results. Randomized test cases avoids the Pesticide paradox. 

Pesticide paradox: if the same set of test cases are executed again and again over the period of time then these set of tests are not capable enough to identify new defects in the system. 

The main project doesn't do anything other than validation of data. 


PS Here, we focus on the test data themselves.
